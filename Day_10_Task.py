 # #Hereâ€™s a mini-project idea based on the concept of logging, exception handling, and file management. This exercise will help students apply the concepts in a practical scenario while reinforcing their understanding.

# Mini-Project: Library Management System Log Tracker
# Problem Statement
# Create a program that simulates a library management system where users can:

# Borrow books.
# Return books.
# Check available books.
# The program should:

# Log all user actions (borrow, return, invalid inputs, etc.) and any exceptions into a log file.
# At the end of the program, the log file should be cleared and reset for the next session.

# TIPS:-
# Setup:

# Create a list of books available in the library (e.g., ["Harry Potter", "1984", "To Kill a Mockingbird"]).
# Use a dictionary to keep track of which books are borrowed (e.g., {"Harry Potter": False, "1984": True}).
# Menu:

# Present the user with a menu:
# View available books
# Borrow a book
# Return a book
# Exit
# Requirements for Each Action:

# View Books:
# Display all books and their availability.
# Borrow a Book:
# Check if the book is available. If yes, allow the user to borrow and log the action. If not, log an error.
# Return a Book:
# Check if the book is borrowed. If yes, mark it as returned and log the action. If not, log an error.
# Exit:
# Before exiting, clear the log file.
# Error Handling:

# Handle invalid inputs, such as selecting a book that doesn't exist or entering invalid menu options, and log these errors.
# Logging Format:

# Use the following format for logs:
# ruby
# Copy code
# %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
# File Management:

# Ensure the log file is cleared at the end of the program

# books dictionary ->
#     books = {
#         "Harry Potter": {
#             "author": "J.K. Rowling",
#             "genre": "Fantasy",
#             "year": 1997,
#             "borrowed": False
#         },
#         "1984": {
#             "author": "George Orwell",
#             "genre": "Dystopian",
#             "year": 1949,
#             "borrowed": False
#         },
#         "To Kill a Mockingbird": {
#             "author": "Harper Lee",
#             "genre": "Fiction",
#             "year": 1960,
#             "borrowed": False
#         }
#     }
